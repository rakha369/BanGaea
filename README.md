Farming system Reshape Our Old Story this the slogan we use to show our project which is a CROP RECOMMENDATION SYSTEM that apply Machine learning in agriculture🍇🌾

## Motivation 💪💪

Precision agirculture is in trend nowadays. Precision agriculture is a modern farming technique that uses the data of soil charachteristics, soil types, crop yield data, weather conditions and suggests the farmers with the most optimal crop to grow in their farms for maximum yield and profit. This technique can reduce the crop failures and will help the farmers to take informed decision about their farming strategy.

In order to mitigate the agrarian crisis in the current status quo, there is a need for better recommendation systems to alleviate the crisis by helping the farmers to make an informed decision before starting the cultivation of crops.

Read this repo till the last, there's a cool thing at the end :)

## Goal 🎯

To recommend optimum crops to be cultivated by farmers based on several parameters and help them make an informed decision before cultivation

## 1.1 | Importing Libraries and Loading dataset

--> Pandas for handling the data. It contains n number of function for data handling. Refer

--> Numpy for creating and handling the array.

--> Matplotlib for visualizing the data. It also hulpfull in finding patterns in the dataset. Refer

--> Seaborn is a library for making statistical graphics in Python. It builds on top of matplotlib and integrates closely with pandas data structures. Seaborn helps you explore and understand your data.

--> Scikit-learn (Sklearn) is the most useful and robust library for machine learning in Python. It provides a selection of efficient tools for machine learning and statistical modeling including classification, regression, clustering and dimensionality reduction via a consistence interface in Python.


## 1.2 | About the data

--> Nitrogen is so vital because it is a major component of chlorophyll, the compound by which plants use sunlight energy to produce sugars from water and carbon dioxide (i.e., photosynthesis). It is also a major component of amino acids, the building blocks of proteins. Without proteins, plants wither and die.


--> Phosphorus is, therefore, important in cell division and development of new tissue. Phosphorus is also associated with complex energy transformations in the plant. Adding phosphorus to soil low in available phosphorus promotes root growth and winter hardiness, stimulates tillering, and often hastens maturity.

--> Potassium is a critical nutrient that plants absorb from the soil, and from fertilizer. It increases disease resistance, helps stalks to grow upright and sturdy, improves drought tolerance, and helps plants get through the winter.

--> The average soil temperatures for bioactivity range from 50 to 75F. These values are favorable for normal life functions of earth biota that ensure proper organic matter decomposition, increased nitrogen mineralization, uptake of soluble substances, and metabolism.

--> The pH range 5.5–6.5 is optimal for plant growth as the availability of nutrients is optimal.
Besides disease, rainfall can also determine how fast a crop will grow from seed, including when it will be ready for harvesting. A good balance of rain and proper irrigation can lead to faster-growing plants, which can cut down on germination time and the length between seeding and harvest.
